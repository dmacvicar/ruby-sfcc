ruby-sfcc
=========

ruby-sfcc provides the SBLIM client API (http://sblim.wiki.sourceforge.net/Sfcc) for ruby.

FAQ
===

1. Why not using SWIG?

sfcc has a complex API based on function tables to simulate an object
oriented environment in C which would make wrapping it complicated.

2. Why the API?

The motivation is to have the plain API available, and use it to access
the CIMOM, gaining the footprint of SBLIM plus features like the
local interface to talk with the CIMOM without overhead.

So the API is pretty "raw", and it is supposed to be consumed by
ActiveCim (http://github.com/dmacvicar/activecim) which is a more
ruby-like API to do CIM based management.
